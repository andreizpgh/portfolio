            Since my school years, I have been immersed in the world of
            mathematics. The passion for solving interesting problems is the
            most vivid memory of that time. However, at the end of school, maths
            became mundane. I got interested in literature and languages and
            decided to major in the Humanities.

            At university, I became fascinated by everything related to Linux. I
            developed a habit of using open source tools, including in my
            academic pursuits. I spent my free time trying out different Linux
            distributions, exploring window managers, desktop environments, and
            tweaking config files.

            After broadening my horizons, I became interested in programming. I
            realised that with my experience I could bring creativity and
            inspiration to the mundane, combining this with a passion for
            problem solving. Thus, I decided to turn my hobby into a career,
            choosing front-end as my starting point.
